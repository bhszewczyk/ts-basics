# Generics

-   allows us to define reusable dunctions and classes that work with multiple tpes rather than a single type
-   useful when we want to accept one type and return the same type but this type can be any type we want - we cannot use any, because there will be no relationship between the input and the output

## React

-   in tsx files when we write generic function we need to use <T,> not to confuse React with jsx tags
